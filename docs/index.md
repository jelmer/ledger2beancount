# ledger2beancount

[ledger2beancount](https://github.com/beancount/ledger2beancount/) is a
script to automatically convert [Ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/)-based
textual ledgers to [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/) ones.

Conversion is based on (concrete) syntax, so that information that is not
meaningful for accounting reasons but still valuable (e.g., comments,
formatting, etc.) can be preserved.

As input, ledger2beancount supports the file formats from:

* [ledger](https://ledger-cli.org/)
* [hledger](https://hledger.org/)

ledger2beancount aims to be compatible with the latest official release of
beancount.
