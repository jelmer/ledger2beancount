Description: Convert Ledger-based textual ledgers to Beancount ones
 A script to automatically convert Ledger-based textual ledgers to Beancount
 ones.

 Conversion is based on (concrete) syntax, so that information that is not
 meaningful for accounting reasons but still valuable (e.g., comments,
 formatting, etc.) can be preserved.
